The Bergerac Praxis Hub offers opportunities to explore what it really means to live more consciously together.

The Praxis Hub is nestled near the River Dordogne and just a few minutes walk from Bergerac's beautiful town center. A perfect location from which to enjoy both the glorious French countryside and the vibrant medieval town.


## Overview

The Bergerac Praxis hub is gathering people  interested in radically committing, together, to be in kinship with the world as it is. We will joyfully respond to uncertainty together with collective embodied practices that include deep attention to humble activities like breathing, creating living space, or preparing food together.

Beyond the seemingly paradoxical nature of contemplative activism, we carry the intention of the ungraspable concept of a metamodern monastery. Our vision is to create a space where individuals can come together to explore, practice, and embody new ways of being and relating to each other and the world.

The Praxis Hub is a space devoted to the development and deepening of practices for an integrative response to our cultural situation. The Praxis Hub hosts residencies at the service of change agents. A laboratory to test and develop collective practices that can support our capacity to be together in this time of complexity, both individually and collectively.

The Hub is an experiential place that seeks to highlight the activation process resulting from community living. A proposal that aims to bring out another way of thinking and living in the world by questioning the relationship between the intimate and the collective along the question of alterity.

We envision this space as a laboratory for systemic transformation, where we can document and study the effects of our practices on individual and collective wisdom. **Our ultimate goal is to create a model for a receptive way of living, where deep listening informs us towards a transformation grounded in the values of curiosity, engagement and trust.**

## The Praxis residencies and gatherings 

The Bergerac Praxis Hub is a space where individuals can come together to explore, practice, and embody new ways of being and relating to each other and the world. We see this space as a place for experimentation, exploration, and learning, where people can engage in self-work, creative work, and spiritual practices within a supportive and structured framework. We believe that this framework, which combines elements of monastic and secular practices, can facilitate the development of a new paradigm of living and being, one that is more connected, embodied, and expansive.

We are running and hosting a series of [residencies and retreats](https://lifeitself.org/upcoming-residencies-gatherings) that are a spiritual cooking together of various ingredients: people, practices, workshops, art, community life and actual cooking. The residences open a space, a vacuum filled by people and practices too spiritual for politics, too “political” for the monasteries, where we sit with our trouble without giving into the narrowing impulse to [“save the world”](https://lifeitself.org/setting-the-world-to-rights-residency). 

Residencies combine both an activating frame of collective practices (sitting meditation, cooking, cleaning and circling) with the space for you to continue your daily work – a key aspect is learning how we can integrate community and practice, collective and private, absolute and relative in our daily life.

## The Praxis food 

We consider our relation to food seriously at the hub. Our mindful approach envisions a sense of nourishment that integrates silence, gratitude, contemplations as much as delicious plant-based food menus.

Our food praxis is based on 3 principles:

* Caring 
* Degrowing 
* Honoring 

To match the best possible balance between the ethical, the economical, and the ecological aspects of our food system. 
Our Praxis food menus are  inspired by Zen temple tradition to provide a mindful setting for the nourishment of the group. 
Our basic meal system is based on a tripartite system of:

* cereals
* beans + cooked veggies 
* raw veggies 

along with dessert or cookies. 

We buy our food to the fresh market and to the organic local cooperative and use as much as we can local and endemic ingredients. 

The collective meals are always plant-based ones, avoiding non-ethical industrial food. In the same spirit, if some participants want to consume animal-based products, we welcome it as an opportunity to discuss our food system and buy from local farmers at the market.

Finally, we have a Monday to Friday alcohol-free policy. However, we enjoy celebrating and dancing with good wine at the Hub on week-ends. 


## The Praxis Lab 

The Bergerac Hub is a space where individuals can come together to explore, practice, and embody new ways of being and relating to each other and the world. We see this space as a place for **experimentation, exploration, and learning,** where people can engage in self-work, creative work, and spiritual practices within a supportive and structured framework. We believe that this framework, which combines elements of monastic and secular practices, can facilitate the development of a new paradigm of living and being, one that is more connected, embodied, and expansive. 

We envision this space as a laboratory for systemic transformation, where we can document and study the effects of our practices on individual and collective well-being, and explore the potential of these practices to shape the future of society. Our ultimate goal is to create a model for a metamodern, evolutionary way of living that is grounded in the values of interdependence, mindfulness, and compassion, and that has the potential to awaken and activate the full potential of individuals and communities.

For this purpose, the Praxis Lab will serve as a research space to collect data on the relations between spaces, structures, food and practices, and make visible their emotional, spiritual, intellectual effects and what actions emrge from that.  The Praxis Lab team will conduct scientific observations during residencies to document and define the inter-relational human technology that fosters a new way of engaging with the world. The focus is on documenting practices from a "how" perspective, studying how human technology can animate forgotten skills of creativity and adjustment. The team will investigate questions such as: what is required to act from a space beyond thinking, what inner movement does this activate, and what are the effects of this posture? They will also explore the concept of a space as a place of practice ( dojo)  and how to document self-research in a reproducible way. 

Ultimately, the research conducted at the Praxis Lab at the Bergerac Hub aims to not only improve the well-being of individuals and communities, but also to contribute to the development of a more interconnected, compassionate and mindful mettamodern society. Through documenting and studying the effects of our practices, we hope to inform and inspire others to create similar spaces and practices that can lead to systemic transformation.

## Key info

* **What do we do at the Praxis hub?** We explore the liminal space of collective and personal awakening to cultivate the disposition to be at ease with whatever comes and adjust to it .
* **How do we do it?** We believe in a Praxis ecology that provides a frame combining both a dynamic regenerative engagement for the collective and the space for you to continue your daily work. A key aspect is learning how we can integrate daily practices (sitting, cooking, cleaning, connecting) as an activation rather than an obligation (a service you give to your Self). Each residency is oriented around a key theme or question. More details can be found in the Section “[Upcoming residencies](https://lifeitself.org/upcoming-residencies-gatherings)”.

## About the Praxis Hub

Located just a few steps from the river and a serene park, this space is a one-of-a-kind setting comprising three small buildings. An old French palazzo, where traces of the past engage us in a heteroclite manner, adds to the unique atmosphere. It is the perfect place for deep exploration amidst its atmospheric surroundings.
