### About the book

"Second renaissance" talks to our hearts as well as our minds. It interweaves personal stories with a wider analysis of our current societies. The book combines the political, artistic, social and spiritual. It is a call for hope in life itself and our collective humanity. It is a hope grounded in reality, discerning enough to avoid the mirages of false promises and to see the true signs of the second renaissance. 

The book unfolds in three parts:

- **A child of modernity**: where I came from, what brought me to this enquiry.
- **In a secular world the ego is God**: a diagnosis to what has lead us to the current crisis.
- **The song of spring for a second renaissance**: the existing signs of a second renaissance and a picture of the elements and principals of this renewal.
