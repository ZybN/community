The book is political, artistic, social and spiritual. It is a call for hope in life itself and our collective humanity. A hope that is grounded in reality and discerns the mirages of the current paradigm through the second renaissance. 

The book unfolds in three parts:

- *A child of modernity*: where I came from, what brought me to this enquiry.

- *In a secular world the ego is God*: a diagnosis to what has lead us to the current crisis.

- *The song of spring for a second renaissance*: the existing signs of a second renaissance and a picture of the elements and principals of this renewal.
