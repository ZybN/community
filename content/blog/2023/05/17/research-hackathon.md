### Theme for the hackathon

The theme for this hackathon is **Learning Resources and knowledge mapping**, around which we have a couple of project ideas. You are welcome to join and help out with these or you can bring your own ideas for projects that are connected with any of the broader [Life Itself Research Community topics](https://lifeitself.org/research#topics).

One project we will be working on is creating curated lists of learning resources like reading lists for people interested in a radically wiser, weller world üåç (see more details [here](/notes/reading-lists-hackathon-project))

The goal of this is to help direct people towards high quality learning resources around particular topic areas. e.g. answering questions such as "How can I learn about topic X as a newcomer?" and "What are the canonical texts for topic X?".

Some inspiration for this (not in our area but showing the kind of idea):

- [Places Journal reading lists](https://placesjournal.org/reading-lists/)
- [LessWrong library](https://www.lesswrong.com/library)
- [notion reading lists](https://parameter.io/notion-reading-list-templates/)
- [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/system-design)

This connects with broader effort to create **high-level knowledge map**: an interactive knowledge map viz that ties together topics of focus within Life Itself, addressing the questions: "What topics is Life Itself interested in?" and "What topics are adjacent or related to X?"

Knowledge map inspiration:

#### What is a hackathon?

A hackathon (also known as a hack day; a portmanteau of hacking and marathon) is an event where people engage in rapid and collaborative engineering over a relatively short period of time such as 24 or 48 hours. As this event is hosted by the Life Itself Research community we will be working on research projects that aren't exclusively confined to coding.
