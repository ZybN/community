I'm on a 45 day road trip across the USA. 

The purpose: to explore the wild nature of the country and to be immersed in the culture along the way. 

The trip started in L.A. and will finish there too. I'm already 6 days in and currently sat at a picnic table in Glen Canyon, Arizona. 

Here you can see my general route, although like all great adventures the planned path must always be swayed from.

## Are you on my path? 

I'm here to make a quick call out to any intentional communities, or interested folks along my route, who would like to connect. Mostly, I am curious to visit and explore some intentional communities along the way and see how to idea of conscious community translates across the other side of the world (from Europe). 

If you are, please drop me an email at nathen@lifeitself.org and I will try my best to come and visit! 

## Observations so far

While I have yet to visit any intentional communities thus far, one thing I have observed from camping in BLM lands and other free camping areas is that there is a vast network of travellers, boondockers, RV campers, vanlifers, etc. that migrate around the USA. 

While they are not by any stretch an intentional community, I notice a common culture of care, trust and community in these places. With so much land available for free camping up to 14 days at a time, I would be curious to know if there are any travelling intentional communities here in the states.

**I will continue to add to this post as I travel**
